Online Battleship<br><br>

As part of a network project we, a group of 4, decided<br>
to develop an online battleship game in a server/client<br>
pattern. The Sever runs the game and for each 2 clients<br>
that connects to the server a game between the 2 starts<br>
The clients are dumb, they don't have any game logic<br>
which makes the game more secure this one couldn't learn<br>
much from opening up the cient and looking inside. This<br>
also applies to the messages sent between clients and <br>
server. The messages consists of mostly simple data<br>
types and an array.<br>
We uploaded the source code to github <br>
