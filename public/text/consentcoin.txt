Consentcoin<br>
<br>
Consentcoin is an app which organizations and sports clubs can use to ask their members for permission<br>
 to use pictures of the members or their children for commercial and non-commercial use.<br><br>

Consentcoin was developed as part of a group exam project by 3 classmates and I. Our Teacher was the <br>
customer and or the product owner. They had the idea and cencept and we did the design and <br>
implementation. As part of this project we used Unified Process to model the project but strayed from<br>
the plan since our prototype came all to close to a finished product and we skipped construction and <br>
transistion. <br><br>

We tried to follow the MWWM model but unfortunately we placed a lot of logic up in the view and gave <br>
it access to model data, so we didn't suceed in following MWWM.<br><br>

We released the app on google play store.<br>

and you can find the source code on github<br>

The App is localized for english and danish users<br>
