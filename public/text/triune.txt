The Triune is a new religious sect,<br>
which worships Diana, Juno and Morrigan <br>
as the aspects of the Mage, the Warrior and the Hunter.<br>
<br>
The Mage is in charge of the artifice, knowledge, law and magic domains<br>
and have the quarterstaff as her favored weapon, <br>
and her favored enemy are the deceiving Daemons.<br>
The Mage's festival day is on the autumn equinox and she is celebrated<br>
by having a parade in honor of students. <br>
If one wishes to gain the blessing of the Mage, go to the temple<br>
and write down a piece of knowledge in the temple's book of knowledge.<br>
<br>
The Warrior is in charge of the glory, liberation, travel and war domains<br>
and have the longsword as her favored weapon,<br>
and her favored enemy are the enslaving Devils.<br>
The Warrior's festival day is on the summer solstice and she is celebrated<br>
by a parade in honor of soldiers and veterans.<br>
If one wished to gain the blessing of the Warrior, go to the temple<br>
and give a drop of blood in the temple's cauldron of sacrifice.<br>
<br>
The Hunter is in charge of the animal, earth, healing, and sun domains<br>
and have the longbow as her favored weapon,<br>
and her favored enemy are the unnatural Aberrations.<br>
The Hunter's festival day is on the spring equinox and she is celebrated<br>
by having a parade in the honor of hunters.<br>
If one wishes to gain the blessing of the Hunter, go to the temple<br>
and offer up an animal you've caught by yourself.<br>
<br>
The Triune seeks to become the dominant faith of Alecrast.<br>
They hope to achieve this by inspiring the population by giving<br>
them great heroes and so they tend to hire adventures.<br>
The Adventures who keep returning alive from the tasks the Triune<br>
sets them on are elevated up to the rank of Aspiring Hero. <br>
Of course there are ranks above this but since the Triune has just been<br>
formed no one has atained a higher rank.<br>
<br>
Most the requests the Triune set adventures on are retrieving <br>
artifacts left behind by "those before" but other times the quests<br>
involve a more mundane aproach, like rooting out bandits or slaying <br>
a dangerous beast.<br>
<br>
The Triune started a few years ago in Romliearth and have now spread<br>
to Saisjo and have been sanctioned by the council as the religion of<br>
the empire but people have the right to worship (or not) as they like.<br>
