My name is Thomas Nielsen.
I'm a student at Zealand Academy studying computer science on my 3rd semester.
I'm a somewhat outgoing guy, but I can be a bit awkward at times. 
Apart from computers and programming i have a few hobbies, like roleplaying, 
both LARP and tabletop. for LARP I attend 2 larger events each year, one late
spring, the other early fall. The event is called LV-live and is a special blend
of roleplay and drinking with groups attending mostly for one or the other 
reason. As for tabletop i run my own game with 5 of my friends as players in a 
homebrew world, based on a bunch of different weird ideas, where we use the 
Pathfinder 1e ruleset, but more on that in the Pathfinder section.
