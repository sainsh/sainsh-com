The world is old. Older than anyone knows. All people know is that in ancient times the 3 goddesses <br>
came to this world and started teaching the people how to live just and good lives. <br>
For a long time there were 3 large nations: Ohfun, Romliearth and Saisjo. But this didn't last.<br>
A civil war was waged in Ohfun and the nation collapsed. Now only city states remain. <br>
The largest of these are the formerly royal city, now controlled by the Arcane University. <br>
<br>
Saisjo wasn't spared the turmoil and saw two quick successions to the thrown. First by Ondoroth, <br>
who claimed the throne by convincing the previous emperor that he should succeed him. <br>
Then by 3stan, who with his party overthrew Ondoroth, who turned out to be a daemon, <br>
and had wanted to start a war so great, that his master could enter this world. <br>
<br>
The only nation to have had a peaceful time for more than 30 years is Romliearth. <br>
Romliearth is a proud nation who holds up the chivaldic code, with knights being the ideal, <br>
that the people strive to become. <br>
